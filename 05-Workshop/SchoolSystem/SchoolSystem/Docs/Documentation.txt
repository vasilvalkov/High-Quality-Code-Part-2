Bottleneck description: --------------------
#1: Engine.WriteLiine() is redundant and makes no use. It has a Trwad.Sleap(350) and a loop to very big number.


Bug reports: --------------------
Format: #Bug number - Class name - Bug description
Example: #1 - PartnerBankingService - The variable "money" at line 36 overflows when you try to add more than 2.1 billion dollars.
--------
#1 - TeacherAddMarkCommand - The student is generated with the theacher's ID and teacher is generated with the sydent's IDs  and the command throws exception or gives erroneous result.
#2 - Engine - The engine printed command result rightaway instead of waiting for End command an then print all command results as shown in the zero tests output. To fix this I introduced a string builder too accumulate commands result and on the End command it outputs al results altogether.
#3 - StudentListMarksCommand - The command did not include the starting "Student has these marks:" and the ending new line. Also it relied on the improperly positioned method ListMarks() of the Student class. The method has been moved to its correct place in the StudentListMarksCommand class ad was removed from the Student class and IStudent infterface.
#4 -
