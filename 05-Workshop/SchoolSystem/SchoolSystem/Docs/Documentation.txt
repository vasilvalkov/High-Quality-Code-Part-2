Bug reports: --------------------
Format: #Bug number - Class name - Bug description

#1 - TeacherAddMarkCommand - The student is generated with the theacher's ID and teacher is generated with the sydent's IDs  and the command throws exception or gives erroneous result.
#2 - Engine - The engine printed command result rightaway instead of waiting for End command an then print all command results as shown in the zero tests output. To fix this I introduced a string builder too accumulate commands result and on the End command it outputs al results altogether.
